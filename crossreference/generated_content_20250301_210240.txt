Based on the information gathered from Rudy's portfolio website, we can analyze his projects and work experience to determine his preference and proficiency in various programming languages. This analysis will help us rank the languages from most to least preferred/proficient.

### Programming Language Ranking

1. **Python**
   - **Reasoning**: Python is implied to be a significant language for Rudy due to his focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning projects, such as the "Shakespearean GPT" where he implemented Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch, which is a Python-based library. Additionally, Python is commonly used in many AI and ML applications, which Rudy is passionate about.
   - **Projects**: Shakespearean GPT, LipNet.
   - **Experience**: Researching logical query answering over knowledge graphs using LLMs, developing ontology-guided entity extraction systems.

2. **JavaScript (Angular)**
   - **Reasoning**: Rudy is currently working on engineering dependency visualization systems using Clojure/Angular at Intact Financial Corporation. His use of Angular, a popular JavaScript framework, suggests proficiency and preference for JavaScript in front-end development.
   - **Projects**: Claude Folder Upload Helper, You Can Only Read This Once (Blog).
   - **Experience**: Full stack development (Hack the 6ix), indicating the use of JavaScript for web development.

3. **Clojure**
   - **Reasoning**: Clojure is specifically mentioned in his current work at Intact Financial Corporation, indicating proficiency and current use. The language is not commonly used, suggesting a strong preference or specific skill set.
   - **Experience**: Engineering dependency visualization systems.

4. **Java**
   - **Reasoning**: Although not directly mentioned, Java is often a language of choice in computer science education and may be inferred from his comprehensive academic work in computer science and statistics.
   - **Experience**: General software engineering internships and projects often rely on Java, though not explicitly mentioned, it is implied.

5. **C/C++**
   - **Reasoning**: While not directly stated, these languages are often foundational in computer science education and could have been used in his various systems engineering and software optimization projects.
   - **Experience**: Potential use in projects like "PortAudio," which requires cross-platform support.

### Conclusion

Rudy demonstrates a clear preference and proficiency in Python and JavaScript due to his extensive work in AI/ML projects and web development. His current work with Clojure also suggests a specialized skill in this functional programming language. Java and C/C++ are likely part of his toolset, given their foundational nature in computer science education and general software development. This ranking reflects Rudy's focus on leveraging modern, versatile, and high-demand languages to build scalable and impactful software solutions.
