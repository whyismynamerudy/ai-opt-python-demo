  "result": "Rudy is a dynamic computer science student at the University of Toronto, where he is completing his final year with an impressive CGPA of 3.91/4.00. His academic focus lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, mathematics, and statistics, reflecting his passion for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and innovative software engineering.\n\nCurrently, Rudy is gaining hands-on experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Intact Financial Corporation. In this role, he is involved in engineering dependency visualization systems using Clojure/Angular, automating OpenShift cluster management, and streamlining release cycles. Additionally, Rudy is expanding his entrepreneurial skills by contributing to the AI/ML ecosystem through Shopify's Builder Sundays.\n\nRudy's previous experiences include researching logical query answering over knowledge graphs using large language models at the Computational Social Sciences Lab under Professor Ashton Anderson. He also developed ontology-guided entity extraction systems at the Urban Data Center and worked on auto-colorization of black and white images at UTMIST, leveraging the \"Colorful Image Colorization\" technique by Richard Zhang et al.\n\nAs a co-founder and former CTO of an ed-tech startup in the UofT HatcheryNest program, Rudy honed his leadership and technical skills. He has also led the development of an open-source dashboard cloning system for UNICEF, significantly reducing clone times across multiple offices.\n\nRudy's technical toolkit includes a range of languages, frameworks, and databases. He has developed several notable projects, such as \"Pitch Please,\" an AI-powered pitch feedback system, and \"UnsearchableTO,\" which uses AI to make Toronto searchable by over half a million objects.\n\nOutside of his technical pursuits, Rudy enjoys rock climbing, hip-hop, and working out. He often creates YouTube content about his experiences as a university student. Rudy welcomes connections via email or LinkedIn, where he is eager to engage with like-minded individuals passionate about technology and innovation.",
