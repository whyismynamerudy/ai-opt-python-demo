# AI Web Agent Performance Comparison

## Overview

This repository contains results from experiments comparing AI web agent performance on two versions of the same website: one optimized for AI agents and one standard version. The experiments explore how AI-optimized websites affect agent efficiency, accuracy, and content generation capabilities.

## Repository Structure

- **Python Scripts**: 
 - `comparison.py`: Visualizes performance metrics
 - `standard_web_agent.py`: The standardized AI web agent

- **Experiment Folders**: Each folder contains results for a specific task
 - `explore_and_write_bio/`: Bio writing experiment
 - `crossreference/`: Programming language analysis
 - `list_of_keywords/`: Professional brand keyword extraction
 - `most_complex_projects/`: Project identification
 - `list_social_media_platforms/`: Social media detection

- **Result Files**:
 - `*_metrics_standardized.json`: Performance metrics for each run
 - `comparison_results_standardized.json`: Comparative analysis
 - `generated_content_*.txt`: Content produced by the agents

## Finding Results

For each experiment, check the corresponding folder for:
1. JSON metrics files with detailed performance data
2. Generated content files with the agent's outputs
3. Comparison results showing the differences between optimized and regular website performance

The repository demonstrates various approaches to AI-website interaction and provides data for analyzing the impact of website optimization on AI agent performance.
